# VEYLORIA ONLINE: *Legends Begin With You*

A 2D fantasy MMORPG with a top-down 3/4 view. It's built with TypeScript, Phaser 3 (WebGL), HTML/CSS UI and Vite.

> **Status: Phase 1 (Playable Game Foundation): done and tested in single-player development mode.**
> The art and audio are **procedural placeholders** that the game generates itself; you can swap in real assets through the asset manifest.
> Online play (accounts, server, party, guild, trading) is planned for Phase 3 and isn't built yet.

## ภาพรวม (Thai summary)
- **เล่นได้จริงตั้งแต่สร้างตัวละครจนปราบบอสตัวแรก** ได้แก่ หน้าเมนู → สร้าง/เลือกตัวละคร (3 สล็อต) → Willowbrook → Sunny Meadow → Whispering Forest → เปลี่ยนอาชีพ → ปราบ *Grukk the Thornking* → จบ Chapter 1
- ระบบที่ทำเสร็จแล้ว ได้แก่ การเดิน (คลิกเมาส์/WASD), กล้องติดตาม, Collision ที่ตรงกับภาพ, NPC/บทสนทนา, Monster AI แบบ State Machine, การต่อสู้แบบ Real-time พร้อมธาตุและ Status, EXP/เลเวล (Base และ Job), Stat Points, Inventory/Equipment, สกิลและ Hotbar, เควสต์ 17 เควสต์, ร้านค้า, คลังเก็บของ, การเซฟ/โหลดแบบมีเวอร์ชัน, เสียง และ UI ครบชุดสำหรับ Phase 1
- ภาพและเสียงตอนนี้เป็น **Placeholder ที่เกมสร้างขึ้นเอง** (ต้นฉบับทั้งหมด) และเปลี่ยนเป็น Artwork จริงได้ผ่าน `public/assets/asset-manifest.json` โดยไม่ต้องแก้ Logic
- ระบบออนไลน์ยังไม่ได้ทำ (อยู่ใน Phase 3)

## Quick start

Requirements: **Node.js 20+** (tested with Node 22) and npm.

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # type-check + production build into dist/
npm run preview      # serve the production build → http://localhost:4173
```

### Tests
```bash
npm test                 # all unit + integration tests (Vitest)
npm run test:unit        # unit tests only
npm run test:integration # headless playthrough + class balance tests
npm run test:e2e         # builds, then drives the real game in Chromium (Playwright)
npm run assets:manifest  # regenerate public/assets/asset-manifest.json from data
```
`test:e2e` uses Playwright's Chromium. If it isn't installed: `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Controls
| Action | Mouse | Keyboard (rebindable in Settings) |
|---|---|---|
| Move | Left-click the ground (click the minimap to travel) | WASD / arrow keys |
| Attack | Left-click a monster (keeps auto-attacking) | Tab = target the nearest monster |
| Talk / interact | Left-click an NPC or object | F = nearest NPC/object |
| Pick up loot | Left-click the item | Z = nearest item |
| Skills / items | Click a hotbar slot | 1–0 |
| Stop / cancel | Right-click | Esc closes windows |
| Windows | Bottom-right buttons | I inventory · E equipment · C status · K skills · Q quests · M world map · O settings |
| Chat | | Enter (`/help` lists commands) |

Ground-target skills (Arrow Rain, Wind Trap, Fire Wall, Thunderstorm, Meteor) land on your current target. If you have no target, they land under the mouse cursor.

## GM / admin tools

Open them with the **GM** button (bottom right), **F8**, or `/gm` in chat. You can:
- heal, toggle god mode, add levels / Luma / stat and skill points, change class
- give any item
- teleport, spawn monsters near you, defeat all monsters on the map
- fill or reset quest objectives

The tools edit the local save only, and any use sets `flags.gmUsed` on the character. The commands live in `src/core/gm.ts`. When the game moves to a server (Phase 3), they must become server-side commands behind an admin role.

## Test results (this commit)

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit (`tests/unit`, 7 files) | **94 / 94 passed**: GM commands, data validation and map reachability, formulas, combat and elements, inventory/shop/storage, quests, save/migrations, world simulation (collision, portals, AI, skills, boss, invalid commands, no double-spend) |
| Integration: full playthrough | **passed**. A bot using only player commands creates a Novice, runs the main quest line, becomes a Knight, defeats Grukk, and completes Chapter 1 (≈71 simulated minutes, Base Lv 18) |
| Integration: class balance | **passed**. First-try boss wins at Lv 17: Knight 6/6, Ranger 6/6, Mage 4/6 (fixed seeds) |
| E2E in Chromium (`npm run test:e2e`) | **23 / 23 checks passed** (incl. GM window): boot, create character via UI, WASD, click NPC → dialogue → accept quest, windows by hotkey, portal travel, mouse-click combat kill with EXP, save and reload persistence, shop purchase, drag & drop equip, stat allocation, job change via dialogue, learn skill, drag skill to hotbar, cast by hotkey, death → respawn, drop part of a stack via the quantity dialog, delete a character with typed-name confirmation, zero page errors |

Screenshots from the e2e run are written to `tests/e2e/screenshots/` (git-ignored).

**Batch 001 art (Willowbrook Starter Pack):** asset QA **551 / 551** checks passed (`npm run assets:batch001`), and the in-game demo **26 / 26** (`npm run demo:batch001`). See [docs/art/BATCH001.md](docs/art/BATCH001.md).

```
See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/ASSET_PIPELINE.md](docs/ASSET_PIPELINE.md).

## Not done yet (honest list)
- **Most art and all audio are still placeholders.** Batch 001 production art covers the Novice, Leaf Slime, Mushling, Horn Rabbit, Willowbrook (tiles, props, buildings) and 4 VFX ([docs/art/BATCH001.md](docs/art/BATCH001.md)). Everything else (the other classes, NPCs, monsters and maps, plus all music and SFX) is still generated at runtime.
- **No multiplayer.** There's no login/register, server, database, party, guild, trading or marketplace (Phase 3). Chat only echoes locally and says so. Saves live in browser `localStorage`.
- **Not built in Phase 1:** Priest, Assassin and Merchant; advanced jobs; refinement (a stat-scaling hook exists in `refineMods`, but there's no UI or NPC); monster cards; Rune Constellation; pets and mounts; crafting; dungeons; world events; day/night; weather; PvP; Guild War.
- Only 3 of the 30 maps, 8 of the 60 monsters, and 1 test boss (Grukk) exist. The 6 major bosses are planned for Phase 4.
- The world map shows the other regions as "Unexplored". They're labels, not playable areas.

## Known issues
- Balance has been tuned with bots (`tests/integration`), not human playtesters. A careless Novice can still die often around Lv 9–11 near wasps and goblins.
- Monsters don't collide with each other, so they can overlap (classic RO-style).
- Name labels can overlap when a player stands right next to an NPC or monster.
- The production JS bundle is about 1.5 MB (mostly Phaser), so Vite prints a chunk-size note.
- Performance has only been checked with the Phase 1 entity counts (about 40 monsters per map). It hasn't been load-tested.
- The layout targets desktop 1280×720 and scales to fit the window. There are no touch controls.

## Next phase (Phase 2: Complete RPG System)
Add Priest, Assassin and Merchant plus the advanced jobs and full skill trees. Add refinement +1…+15 (results resolved in the simulation only), monster cards, Rune Constellation, pets and mounts, and crafting. Expand to 10 maps. All of it plugs into the existing data files and `World` APIs. Phase 3 then moves `World` onto a Node.js (Colyseus) server with PostgreSQL/Redis for authoritative online play.

## Credits & licensing
All code, data, procedural art and synthesized audio in this repository are original. The game is inspired by classic MMORPGs, but it doesn't use any characters, art, maps or sounds from other games.
